This is a 'native' UWP app that holds a number of 'test' pages, each of which serves to demo a particular ViewModel that exercises interesting facets of the IntensityMapViewer.

The app structure was created using Windows Template Studio.

ViewModel classes and UI Pages relating to the overall structure are in the 'ViewModels' and 'Views' directories :

  ShellViewModel / ShellPage

  MainViewModel / MainPage

  BlankViewModel / BlankPage

  SettingsViewModel / SettingsPage

ViewModel classes and UI Pages relating to the IntensityMap 'demos' are in the 'Demo_ViewModels' and 'Demo_Pages' directories.

  The 'demo' view models are contained within the project, and in some cases refer to UWP-specific features.
  


All the demo ViewModel classes and Pages are registered with the ViewModelLocator :

  - We register the association between the ViewModel and the associated Page type.
  - We expose properties that provide access to the ViewModel instances.

The 'ShellPage.xaml' file is where we list the available Pages, eg

  <winui:NavigationViewItem 
    x:Uid="Shell_IntensityMapTest" 
    Icon="Document"
    helpers:NavHelper.NavigateTo="IntensityMapViewer.IntensityMapTestViewModel" 
  />

The Uid property defines the string that's displayed on the menu items in the left hand panel.
The 'NavigateTo' attached property defines the ViewModel type assiciated with the menu item.
