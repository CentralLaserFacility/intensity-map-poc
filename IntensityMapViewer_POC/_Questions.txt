Documentation for WriteableBitmap.PixelBuffer ??

OK to enable C# 9 with 'IsExternalInit' and <LangVersion> ??

Spurious intellisense errors in Visual Studio
  Happens consistently in Uno projects ...
  Also in 'ordinary' UWP and WPF projects ... XAML designer ???

After a source code change, and running the app again, 
sometimes changes haven't been applied ?

Image display, and Profiles
  All with UWP ?? : WriteableBitmap ; Canvas / Line etc
  All with Skia ??
  Mixture ?? eg WriteableBitmap for image, Skia for graphs ??

Skia support in WinUI ??
  Simple text project had version incompatibilities ...

Syncfusion UWP books in our Teams, or in our private GitHub ?

UWP end-of-life ???
https://nicksnettravels.builttoroam.com/net5-crossplatform/
Microsoft hasn't confirmed this (and in much the same way that Silverlight was never discontinued, I doubt anyone will say this) but UWP as it stands today is effectively end-of-life. I doubt it will get NetStandard 2.1 or .NET 5 support.

---------------------

Skeleton : 
  Dependency Injection
    Services configured in 'App.Loaded'
    Working with XUnit tests ; statics ??
  Writing 'log' messages
    System.Diagnostics.Debug 
    Scrolling window in the app ?
    Enabling categories of messages etc
  Handling uncaught exceptions
  Timer at the 'app' level ?
  Messenger, or MediatR ?

-----------------------------

View Models structure

  Parent-Child nesting, with links back to parent

  DisplayPanel
    Source
      SourceSettings
      ProfileDisplaySettings
    ImagePresentationSettings
    UserPreferences

  Events ...

    New image acquired
    Setting changed
    Profile Display position changed

    Hmm - centralised dispatch, via a 'hub' ???
    Or maybe just rely on INotifyPropertyChanged ??

  Timer - created in 'App' ?? or per ViewModel ??

  Handling 'Loaded' and 'Unloaded' events ??

--------------------------

  IDisplayPanelViewModel etc ... worth it ?
  Interfaces useful when initially thinking things through,
  but possibly little benefit now if we're building a tree
  of concrete classes ...

---------------

  IIntensityMap etc - still useful as we'll plug in
  improved implementations over time ...
