Binding the DataContext property of a UserControl

Say I have a Page, and on it a UserControl. The Page has a RootViewModel,
and the RootViewModel has a 'child' ViewModel whose properties I want to
interact with via my UserControl :

  class MyPage
  {
    RootViewModel ViewModel => DataContext as RootViewModel ;
  }

  class RootViewModel
  {
    public ChildViewModel ChildViewModel { get ; }
  }

In the Page's XAML :

  <MyUserControl DataContext="{x:Bind ViewModel.ChildViewModel, Mode=OneWay}" />

------------

That's fine, but to make it work, you have to hook into the DataContexChanged event
in the Page, and explicitly call 'Bindings.Update()'.

  MyPage ( )
  {
    this.InitializeComponent();
    DataContextChanged += (s,e) => {
      this.Bindings.Update() ; // Yikes - gotta call this explicitly ? WTF !!!
    } ;
  }

Isn't it very surprising that this is necessary ? After all, if the DataContext changes,
surely you'd expect that all the UI elements would need to be refreshed ?

I suppose the reasoning here is that x:Bind will be mentioning a specific Property,
in our case one called 'ViewModel'. Depending on how that property is implemented,
it would not necessarily be affected by a change to the DataContext - but in our case
we're getting it *from* the DataContext. This means we can avoid declaring 
a DependencyProperty to represent our ViewModel property.
