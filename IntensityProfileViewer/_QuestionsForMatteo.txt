  GitHub. Checking out a repo, opening the available solutions from that repo ?? 
  Have to do File/Open then remember the repo location.

  How to exclude projects from a 'build solution' ; Configuration Manager check boxes ignored ??

  XAML designer is busy ...

  Nuget Package Explorer ??

  UserControl : 'Width' can be NaN even when ActualWidth is a valid number ?

  Trigger binding change on resize, when a Bind target depends on panel size ...

  Putting lots in the Shared project make the project files simpler, but is horrid for all sorts of reasons
  Each UserControl should be independently testable in a 'demo' panel
