
Some specific questions / topics ...

  Visual layer geometric objects eg lines, shapes - but TEXT ???
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/visual-layer-in-desktop-apps
  The Visual Layer does not have a primitive for rendering text.
  WTF ???
  Aha - is the new DWriteCore relevant here ?

  => DWrite provides very-high-quality text rendering ; not used in XAML.

  ?? Role of the 'Composition' API ??
  Really for animation and 3D effects ?
  Has 'rounded rectangle', nice
  Points (eg for CompositionLineGeometry) are specified as System.Numerics.Vector2.
  Microsoft.UI.Composition.CompositionPath ... ??? no docs !!!
  Visual, etc ; transformation matrix is 4x4 ??? ie for 3D manipulations

  Putting 'library' code in the Shared project avoids the need to set up
  multiply targeted project files, but is horrid for all sorts of reasons.
  Roll on .Net 6 where this will be sorted :)

  How to set things up so that graphics is refreshed at the maximum 60Hz rate ?
  DispatcherTimer can only work at up to 20Hz, fair enough.
  Can trigger events at faster rates (eg 50Hz) via a System.Threading.Timer,
  but that seems wrong, and need to marshall to the UI thread anyway.

  Even when using DispatcherTimer at 20mS : what happens if a UI update
  takes longer than 20mS ? Are Tick events discarded ??

  General point : Confusion about LAYOUT - WHAT DETERMINES SIZES ???
  Is there a succinct description anywhere ? It's complicated ...

  WPF had a LayoutTransform, and routed events that could be previewed (tunnelling/bubbling).
  Also 'DrawingVisuals' that were lightweight, drawing text as well as shapes.
  Are there any notes that explain how to work around these omissions in UWP ?

  UIElement / FrameworkElement / subclasses ... 
  WOULD LIKE BETTER DOCUMENTATION OF THE XAML OBJECT MODEL !!!

  Reasons to HATE XAML !!!
    - Comments can't be nested, so it's impossible to use commenting <!-- --> 
      to try out alternatives or keep previous versions around. This is especially annoying
      given that one often needs to 'experiment' with various combinations
      of attributes etc to 'see what works' ...
    - Can't document Attributes with comments ...
    - Too verbose, lots of cermonial syntax that gets in the way of comprehension
    - Intellisense is flakey, often lags behind (needs rebuild to get rid of all squigglies)
    - Linking to definitions in a different XAML file is really ugly (StaticResource etc)
    - NO WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT THE DEFAULTS ARE FOR ATTRIBUTES that AREN'T EXPLICITLY MENTIONED.
      This is not the fault of XAML, but the poor documentation of the object model.
    - The designer doesn't work very well, runtime results are not what you see in the designer.
      Aha, hence hot reload, but that's flakey too, hopefully will work better in .Net 6
    - XML is an interchange format, never intended to be written by humans :) :)
    ROLL ON C# FOR MARKUP !!!
      Aha, Hot Reload is going to work throughout .Net 6, even in WinForms etc.
      So this means one could define the UI markup in C#, edit it on-the-fly
      and have the UI update, without losing the application state ?
      Is Hot Reload meant to work with *any* change in the application logic ??
      Hmm, great if it works - but surely that's a very hard problem ?

  => Hot Reload ... aim is to replicate the experience provided with React Native

  Best tool for creating assets eg splash screen, logo etc ? from a single 'master' file, ideally.

  => Manifest editor, just select the 'source' ...

  How to show a splash screen that indicates progress getting the app ready to run (eg creating our simulated images)
  ?? Better, start the app as soon as poss and build the example images in the background.
  ?? Is there an equivalent of 'OnIdle' ?? Or just set off an async operation to build images and add them.

  => Can replace the default 'static' splash screen with one defined in XAML, eg showing an animation to indicate 'loading ...'

  Lack of a Designer for WinUI ? Not really a problem :
  - Hot Reload is a great alternative
  - The designer (even in UWP) never worked well anyhow :)
  BUT :
    When working on a specific piece of the UI (eg a UserControl),
    need a convenient way of running a skeleton app that creates an instance
    of that UserControl, with some 'typical' dummy data (ie a default ViewModel).
    Not hard to do provided the UserControls are in a separate project ?
    I was about to write a little app that would 'host' any UserControl, 
    but am unsure about the best way to package shareable UserControls 
    including their required XAML resources.

-------------------------------------

Reminders of topics to maybe talk about ...

Visual Studio issues :

  Feedback ... nice to offer this, but too many thousands of items !!!
  https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/report?port=1027&fsid=83affe24-2f4b-4691-81db-ae17a8b346d3&entry=problem&space=8

  => As we're in the TAP programme, can use 'Collaborate' feature to report issues ...

  Quirks using GitHub integration. Checking out a repo, opening the available solutions from that repo ?? 
  Have to do File/Open then remember the repo location.

  Git issues - directory not being seen as a Git repo even though it has a .git directory ???

  Is it worthwhile to use 16.10 preview these days, or best to stick with 16.9.x (which Jerome is using for Uno)

  How to exclude projects from a 'build solution' ; Configuration Manager check boxes are being ignored ??

  Bugs ... XAML designer is busy ... sometimes VS freezes ...

  On 'references', sometimes see a yellow triangle ; how to get info about what's wrong ???

  => Yes, it's a problem !!

  Is there a way to 'open' a Nuget package and see what classes etc are provided ?
  Nuget Package Explorer ?? Is it useful ??

  => Just use a decompilation tool ... hmm, not good !!

  UserControl : 'Width' can be NaN even when ActualWidth is a valid number ?
  [ Aha ... Width property is the 'suggested width' ??? ]

  Each UserControl should be independently testable in a 'demo' panel.

  Geometry class (in Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Media)
    Specifies data for a Path (all rendered with same stroke/brush)
    ??? How is the underlying information accessed ??
    ??? Aha, just in terms of the properties that have been set up
    Under the hood, something turns a Geometry into pixels

  Shape class :
    Line, Rectangle, Path ... etc
    GeometryTransform (3x3 matrix ie 2D)
    RenderTransform (3x3 matrix ie 2D)
    IsHitTestVisible !!! PointerEntered etc
    Stroke / Brush

-------------------------

  So many options for 'custom rendering' ...
    XAML (and associated classes eg Geometry, Shape)
    Composition ...
    Visual ...
    Win2D
    Skia    *** Cross platform, Uno converts to this
                Also runs on Windows, but not the 'native' API ...

---------------------

  For pan/zoom (eg in MachineSafety network diagram) need to apply
  a Transform to *all* the elements in a container.
  In WPF, we have DrawingVisuals in a ContainerVisual, can apply a Transform 
  to the container and all the children are affected.
  Is there a way to do this in UWP XAML, eg to all child elements of a Canvas ???
  *** Aha, OF COURSE, can apply a ScaleTransform or whatever to the Canvas, no problem.

--------------------------------

  Uno issue ?? Attempting to add TabView in Shared project - failed, parameter is incorrect ('broken' branch)

--------------------------

  SkSwapChainPanel !!

  UnoSkiaSharpFiddle ...

XAML scrolling, panning, and zooming sample
https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-microsoft/tree/411c271e537727d737a53fa2cbe99eaecac00cc0/Official%20Windows%20Platform%20Sample/Universal%20Windows%20app%20samples/111487-Universal%20Windows%20app%20samples/XAML%20scrolling%2C%20panning%2C%20and%20zooming%20sample/C%23/Shared
Hmm, this is now ARCHIVED.
And not very useful, because the only feature shown in 'Scenario3_Zooming.xaml' is setting 'ZoomMode' in the ScrollViewer, to enable pinch gestures.

========================

WinUI docs & books ?

Microsoft docs
  Make sense when you already understand, poor for tutorial purposes.
  They talk about surface level features, but underlying concepts not explained well.
  Easily get stuck when trying to do things that you'd expect to be straightforward.

Events to Commands, in XAML, with Community Toolkit ?
Does it work in Uno ?

Not Uno-related, but ...
  What's the cleanest way to call a Javascript function from C# ?
  Microsoft.JSInterop.JSRuntime ... from ASP.Net.Core 5.0
  Can call from a Blazor app, of course ...
  But from a WinUI app ? 
  In order to use a graphical layout package called 'Dagre'.
  And can JSRuntime invoke a WebAssembly module ?

Nice post about the WVVM Toolkit, from the XamlBrewer people ...
