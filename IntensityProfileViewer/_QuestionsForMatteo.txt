Visual Studio issues :

  Feedback ... too many thousands of items !!!
  https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/report?port=1027&fsid=83affe24-2f4b-4691-81db-ae17a8b346d3&entry=problem&space=8

  GitHub. Checking out a repo, opening the available solutions from that repo ?? 
  Have to do File/Open then remember the repo location.

  How to exclude projects from a 'build solution' ; Configuration Manager check boxes ignored ??

  XAML designer is busy ...

  Nuget Package Explorer ??

  UserControl : 'Width' can be NaN even when ActualWidth is a valid number ?
  [ Aha ... this is the 'suggested width' ??? ]

  Trigger binding change on resize, when a Bind target depends on panel size ...

  Putting 'library' code in the Shared project avoids the need to set up
  multiply targeted project files, but is horrid for all sorts of reasons.
  Roll on .Net 6 where this will be sorted :)

  Each UserControl should be independently testable in a 'demo' panel.

  Geometry class (in Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Media)
    Specifies data for a Path (all rendered with same stroke/brush)
    ??? How is the underlying information accessed ??
    ??? Aha, just in terms of the properties that have been set up
    Under the hood, something turns a Geometry into pixels etc

  Shape class :
    Line
    Rectangle
    Path ... etc
    GeometryTransform (3x3 matrix ie 2D)
    RenderTransform (3x3 matrix ie 2D)
    IsHitTestVisible !!! PointerEntered etc
    Stroke / Brush

  Hit test : how to find whether an object is 'hit' at a given position ?

  You can use Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.VisualTreeHelper.FindElementsInHostCoordinates to find UIElements that intersect a specific coordinate.
  To find a point relative to your Canvas you'll need to convert from the Canvas's coordinates to the app window's coordinates, which you can do with UIElement.TransformToVisual. This will take into account scaling as well as translations.

  VisualTreeHelper.FindElementsInHostCoordinates
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.media.visualtreehelper.findelementsinhostcoordinates?view=winrt-19041
  Retrieves a set of objects that are located within a specified x-y coordinate point of an app UI. The set of objects represents the components of a visual tree that share that point.

------------------

  ?? Role of the 'Composition' API ??
  Really for animation and 3D effects ?
  Has 'rounded rectangle', nice
  Points (eg for CompositionLineGeometry) specified as System.Numerics.Vector2.
  Microsoft.UI.Composition.CompositionPath ... ??? no docs !!!
  Visual, etc ; transformation matrix is 4x4 ???

-------------------------

  So many options for 'custom rendering' ...
    XAML (and associated classes eg Geometry, Shape)
    Composition ...
    Visual ...
    Win2D
    Skia    *** Cross platform, Uno converts to this
                Also runs on Windows, but not the 'native' API ...

---------------------

  For pan/zoom (eg in MachineSafety network diagram) need to apply
  a Transform to *all* the elements in a container.

  In WPF, we have DrawingVisuals in a ContainerVisual, can apply a Transform 
  to the container and all the children are affected.

  Is there a way to do this in UWP XAML, eg to all child elements of a Canvas ???
  *** Aha, can apply a ScaleTransform or whatever to the Canvas, no problem.

  Visual layer geometric objects eg lines, shapes - but TEXT ???
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/visual-layer-in-desktop-apps
  The Visual Layer does not have a primitive for rendering text.
  WTF ???

--------------------------------

Git issues - directory not seen as a Git repo ???

Attempting to add TabView - failed, parameter is incorrect ('broken' branch)

--------------------------

  SkSwapChainPanel !!

  UnoSkiaSharpFiddle ...

-------------------------------------

  Confusion about LAYOUT - WHAT DETERMINES SIZES ???
  Is there a sccince description anywhere ? It's complicated ...

  UIElement / FrameworkElement / subclasses ...

----------------------------------------

XAML scrolling, panning, and zooming sample
https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-microsoft/tree/411c271e537727d737a53fa2cbe99eaecac00cc0/Official%20Windows%20Platform%20Sample/Universal%20Windows%20app%20samples/111487-Universal%20Windows%20app%20samples/XAML%20scrolling%2C%20panning%2C%20and%20zooming%20sample/C%23/Shared
Hmm, this is now ARCHIVED.
And not very useful, because the only feature shown in 'Scenario3_Zooming.xaml' is setting 'ZoomMode' in the ScrollViewer, to enable pinch gestures.
