Long filenames are a problem ; even with the magic flag set in the registry,
to enable Long Filenames support :
  Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\LongPathsEnabled => 1
... have to check out the repo into a folder with a very short path such as C:\tmp\uno. 
Otherwise, weird build errors.

Often get spurious red squigglies when building anything but a UWP project.

Should the 'Shared' project contain Assets for splash screen and icon etc ???
Seems that these are actually specific to UWP.


XAML syntax doesn't allow whitespace in the same places that are permitted in UWP ...

  XXX = {            <== THIS PROVOKES LOTS OF OBSCURE ERRORS !!!
    x:Bind ...
  }

That style is useful when you have a complex x:Bind expression with 'BindBack' etc ...

Hey, that's a *remarkably* short list !!!
