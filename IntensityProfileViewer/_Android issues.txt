Viewer App - stuff that doesn't work properly in Droid :

  [ in the emulator, tablet_m-dpi_10_1_in_q_10_0_0_-api_29:5554 ]

  - When the Normalisation Mode is Automatic, the slider that adjusts
    the Normalisation value should be greyed-out. It doesn't respond
    to drags on the slider, but there's no visual indication.

  - When you enter an inappropriate value into a text field such as 'X position',
    the background should change colour to indicate the error.

  - If the virtual keyboard comes up, there's no way of dismissing it
    apart from disabling it from the 'keyboard' button

  - There are no tooltips (fair enough ?)

  - Dragging the cross hairs works fine.

  - Panning works fine.

  - Dragging and panning work fine with touch input as well as with the mouse.
  
  - Zooming with the mouse wheel is broken.
    Stepping the scroll wheel slowly, eg with a whole second between notches,
    has the effect of scrolling up or down. If you step the scroll wheel rapidly,
    quickly forward-and-back, you zoom in by a factor of 2x. You can repeat this
    a further two times to get a total magnification of 8x. 

  - To zoom in, another method is to double-click (or double-tap on a touch screen)
    which zooms you in by 2x centred on the touch point.

  - A two-finger 'pinch' gesture has no effect (you'd expect this to zoom in ?)

  - There seems to be no way to zoom back out via a mouse or touch gesture.
    The 'Reset Pan/Zoom' button works though.

  - Splash screen doesn't appear in Droid (fair enough).

==========================

In Droid, we initially get (on screen)
  NormalisationMode  : Automatic
  NormalisationValue : 8  <=== THIS IS NOT CORRECT      
Even though the NormalisationMode is Automatic, the NormalisationValue
is somehow being evaluated as a very low value, which produces a washed-out image.
Probably caused by an initialisation-order issue ; the NormalisationValue being
computed from an image that doesn't contain valid data.

==================

On the emulated Tablet, screen size reported as 1280 x 728.

On startup there are warning messages :
  requestLayout() improperly called
  BindableAttribute is missing and the type [IntensityProfileViewer.DisplayPanelViewModel] is not known by the MetadataProvider. Reflection was used instead of the binding engine and generated static metadata. Add the Bindable attribute to prevent this message and performance issues.
  Same warning for many other ViewModel types.

================

On phone :

Colour map drop-down has painting glitches.
