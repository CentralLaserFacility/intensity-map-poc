### Check laser alignment

- Change to the appropriate source
- Adjust the settings (Gain) for that source until the intensity value is suitable (say max intensity is > 100 and < 200 as a rough guide)
- Check that the current beam position is in the correct location (just check the pixel position of the beam in this case)
- Switch to another source and do the same



### Check the laser beam spatial profile 

First, look at overall picture

- Choose display to the source you want
- Set intensity scale to auto
- Reposition the profile location so that the cross-sections are taken through the laser spot
- Look at the cross-section graphs to check they look good (in the real world, would the fix would be hardware so nothing to do here)

Then look at low level signal that can cause problems

- Change from automatic to manual gain, and set the gain level to show the low level noise in the image
- Inspect the (rescaled) cross-section plots and image to check that not too much signal is in the area outside of the main laser spot



### Save an image of the laser spot

- Set the gain/display value to show the spot nicely
- Apply the colour palette of choice so the image is coloured as desired
- Export the current data to a standard file format



### Check the laser spot for abnormalities

- Bring up desired source
- Adjust gain and max display value to get a clear image
- Pan/zoom in to the region around the laser spot in the image
- Check image and cross-sections for smoothness (are there any sudden variations in intensity? We don't want images and profiles to be too 'spiky')
