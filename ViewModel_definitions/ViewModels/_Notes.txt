This project defines concrete ViewModel classes that implement the 'IViewModel' interfaces defined in the 'DomainDefinitions' project.

These implementations are as simple as we can get away with for the purposes of the Uno 'proof-of-concept' project. In many cases the ViewModel just provides 'fake' data held in memory, whereas in the real implementation we'd connect to a 'model' class.
